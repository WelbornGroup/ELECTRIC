ELECTRIC
====================================

ELECTRIC: Electric fields Leveraged from multipole Expansion Calculations in Tinker Rapid Interface Code.

ELECTRIC uses the MolSSI Driver Interface to perform electric field analysis of Tinker trajectories which use the AMOEBA forcefield. This currently works as a post-processing tool, meaning that you run simulations as normal using Tinker, then analyze the trajectories using MDI-enabled Tinker and this driver. 

ELECTRIC is written by Jessica A. Nash and Taylor A. Barnes from `The Molecular Sciences Software Institute <https://molssi.org/>`_, in collaboration with `Prof. Valerie Vassier Welborn <https://www.valeriewelborn.com/>`_.

Using this tool, you can calculate the electric field along a bond or between atoms due to molecules or residues in the system.

This method has been reported in the following publications:

- `Computational optimization of electric fields for better catalysis design <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-018-0109-2>`_, Nature Catalysis

- `Fluctuations of Electric Fields in the Active Site of the Enzyme Ketosteroid Isomerase <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.9b05323>`_, Journal of the American Chemical Society

- `Computational Optimization of Electric Fields for Improving Catalysis of a Designed Kemp Eliminase <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.7b03151>`_, ACS Catalysis

You can read about the underlying principles of this analysis in 

- `Computational Design of Synthetic Enzymes <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b00399>`_, Chemical Reviews
